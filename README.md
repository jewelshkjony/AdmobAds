## Admob Sdk **‚Üì**

 **Initialize** - Call this method as early as possible after the app launches to reduce latency on the session's first ad request. If this method is not called, the first ad request automatically initializes the Google Mobile Ads SDK.
  
**Ad inspector** - Ad inspector is an in-app overlay that enables authorized devices to perform real-time analysis of test ad requests directly within a mobile app.
  
 **RegisterWebView** - Registers a WebView with the Google Mobile Ads SDK to improve in-app ad monetization of ads within this WebView.
  
**OpenDebugMenu** - Opens the debug menu. Initialize method must be called prior to this function.

## Admob App Open Ad **‚Üì**

## Admob Native Ad **‚Üì**
Native ads allow you to customize the look and feel of the ads that appear in your app. You design the ads from the ground up: how they look, where they‚Äôre placed, and how they work within your existing app design.

You can design the `NativeAdView` using `XML` code like Android Studio.\
Here is a sample of XML file ‚Üì\
üóíÔ∏è <a href="https://github.com/jewelshkjony/AdmobAds/blob/main/output/AdmobNative.xml">AdmobNative.xml</a> | <a href="https://github.com/jewelshkjony/RecyclerNativeAdView/blob/main/files/small_template.xml">small_template.xml</a>

Just you need to upload (.xml) file into builder asset then set the (.xml) file with the extension.\
And populate all views using tags. üì∫ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4QBn2bUYME">(Watch Video)</a>
